Packer KubeVirt Plugin is a powerful and flexible tool designed to create KubeVirt VM images. KubeVirt is a virtualization solution for Kubernetes, and this plugin enables Packer to communicate with KubeVirt to automate the process of building and managing VM images.
The plugin integrates seamlessly with Packer's ecosystem and provides a means to define image configuration in a declarative way, in line with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. Leveraging Packer's capabilities, it allows automated, consistent, and reproducible builds of VM images, making it an excellent choice for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
With Packer KubeVirt Plugin, developers can design, build, and manage VM images for KubeVirt environments, accelerating the application delivery process and reducing the risks associated with manual image creation.
